Hello there, I'm Robert.

I'm a junior full-stack Ruby developer with 7 years science and mathematics teaching experience in Inner London.

Collaboration and challenge are my fuel. I admire energy, confidence and the desire to get dirty. I dig creativity and kindness. I can distil information into clear ideas that are tuned to the ear that's listening.
