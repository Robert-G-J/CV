Hello there, I'm Robert.

I'm a full-stack Ruby and JS developer with 7 years science and mathematics teaching experience in Inner London.

Collaboration and challenge are my fuel. I admire energy, confidence and the desire to get dirty. I dig creativity and openness. I can distil information into clear ideas that are tuned to the ear that's listening.

#### My 'Super-Power' is Communication

That's a pretty broad term, but is encapsulated by an energy and enthusiasm to understand and get the best from the people I work with, by offering openness and humility while inviting direct feedback at any opportunity.

#### I actively use:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Javascript, Jasmine, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Github

#### And care about:
- Design: Object-orientated design that aims to create SOLID, DRY code with TDD
- Collaboration: Pair-programming, Stand-Ups, Retros and 360° Feedback
- Behaviours: Reverence of  XP values and infectious enthusiasm
- Learning driven: Hungry to rapidly learn and work as a knowledge worker
