Hello there, I'm Robert.

I'm a full-stack Ruby and JS developer with 7 years science and mathematics teaching experience in Inner London.

I offer creativity and openness. I listen carefully to distil information into clear concepts that are easily understood.


## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### My 'Super-Power' is Communication

That's a pretty broad term, but is encapsulated by an energy and enthusiasm to understand and get the best from the people I work with, by offering openness and humility while inviting direct feedback at any opportunity.

#### I actively use:

- Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, Javascript, Jasmine, Zombie, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Github, Travis CI, Coveralls, SOLID Principles, Kent Beck's Design Principles, 

#### And care about:
- **Design:** Object-orientated design that aims to create SOLID, DRY code with TDD
- **Collaboration:** Pair-programming, Stand-Ups, Retros and 360° Feedback
- **Behaviours:** Reverence of  XP values and infectious enthusiasm
- **Learning driven:** Hungry to rapidly learn and work as a knowledge worker

### People have said these rather kind things about working with me:
>Rob, you're really great at nailing things down. I think you have a good analytical mind and you are really good at explaining your process as you think through a problem.

>Good energy, fun person to be around. Confident, well liked. positive and takes things with good humour. Genuine listener, not just waiting for your turn to talk. Actually wants to hear your input / opinion

> Your positive attitude. Willingness to work. Awareness of other people and their feelings
